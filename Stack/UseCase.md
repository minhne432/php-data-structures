Stacks are used in various scenarios where data needs to be stored and retrieved in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner. Here are some common use cases for stacks:

### Common Use Cases for Stacks

1. **Function Call Management (Call Stack)**:

   - **Use Case**: Managing function calls in programming languages.
   - **Example**: When a function is called, its execution context is pushed onto the call stack. When the function returns, its context is popped off the stack.

2. **Expression Evaluation and Syntax Parsing**:

   - **Use Case**: Evaluating arithmetic expressions and parsing syntax.
   - **Example**: Converting infix expressions (e.g., `3 + 4 * 2`) to postfix expressions (e.g., `3 4 2 * +`) and evaluating them using stacks.

3. **Backtracking Algorithms**:

   - **Use Case**: Implementing algorithms that require backtracking.
   - **Example**: Depth-first search (DFS) in graphs and solving puzzles like the maze problem, where you need to explore all possible paths and backtrack when a path is invalid.

4. **Undo Mechanism in Software**:

   - **Use Case**: Implementing undo functionality in applications.
   - **Example**: Text editors, graphics software, and other applications use stacks to keep track of user actions, allowing users to undo and redo operations.

5. **Balancing Symbols**:

   - **Use Case**: Checking for balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces in expressions.
   - **Example**: Validating that every opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol in code or mathematical expressions.

6. **Browser History Navigation**:

   - **Use Case**: Managing the history of web pages visited in a browser.
   - **Example**: The browser's back button uses a stack to keep track of the pages visited so that users can navigate back to previously viewed pages.

7. **Tree and Graph Traversal**:

   - **Use Case**: Traversing tree and graph data structures.
   - **Example**: Using a stack to implement iterative versions of depth-first traversal algorithms for trees and graphs.

8. **Memory Management**:
   - **Use Case**: Allocating and deallocating memory dynamically.
   - **Example**: Some memory allocation schemes use stacks to manage memory frames or blocks, particularly in real-time systems.

### Summary

Use a **stack** when:

- You need to manage function calls and execution contexts.
- You are evaluating or parsing expressions and need to handle operators and operands.
- You are implementing backtracking algorithms or depth-first search.
- You want to provide undo functionality in an application.
- You need to validate balanced symbols in expressions.
- You are implementing navigation history in a browser or similar application.
- You are traversing trees or graphs using depth-first traversal methods.
- You need to manage memory allocation and deallocation in a LIFO manner.

Understanding these use cases will help you determine when a stack is the appropriate data structure to use for your specific problem or application.
